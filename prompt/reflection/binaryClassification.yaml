  Given the merged retrieved context and the input query, carefully analyze and evaluate if the context contains all necessary
  information to fully answer the query. Take your time to thoroughly consider the following aspects:
  1. Does the context directly address the main question?
  2. Are all necessary supporting details present?
  3. Is there any critical information missing?

  After careful consideration, first provide a brief reasoning explaining why the context is sufficient or insufficient.
  Then, respond with 'Yes' if the context is sufficient (i.e., it directly addresses the query without missing critical details),
  or 'No' if the context lacks essential information, requires additional data, or is irrelevant to the query.
