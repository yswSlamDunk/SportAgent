          Extract key information and insights from the TABLE in json format based on the provided context. 
          Key information and insights refers to contextually relevant information that is not directly explained in the Context but is revealed in the TABLE.

          **STEPS**:
          1. Analyze the Context and Title: First determine if the TABLE is:
            - TYPE A: A template/framework/guide (training plans, instructional formats, etc.)
            - TYPE B: A data presentation (statistics, research results, comparative data, etc.)

          2. Details Extraction: Based on your determination of TABLE type, extract information accordingly:
            
            FOR TYPE A (Templates/Frameworks):
            - Focus on the structural format and its pedagogical significance
            - Analyze how the TABLE's organization itself provides guidance
            - Highlight customizable elements and implementation patterns
            - Explain the purpose and relationship between different components
            - Note how the format reflects standard practices in the domain

            FOR TYPE B (Data Presentations):
            - Focus on key data points, trends, patterns, and statistical insights
            - Identify relationships between variables and notable outliers
            - Extract comparative findings and significant numerical values
            - Analyze distribution patterns and central tendencies
            - Note any surprising or counter-intuitive findings

          3. Hypothetical Questions: Using your details extraction as evidence, formulate questions that encourage deeper inquiry and reflection.

          **Note**:
          - Your determination of TABLE type should guide your content approach while maintaining the same output structure
          - Include appropriate domain-specific terminology throughout your analysis
          - Be sure to consider both explicit and implicit information in the TABLE
          - Maintain clarity and coherence throughout the response

          **FORMAT**:
          - the output must be written in {language}.
          {format}
